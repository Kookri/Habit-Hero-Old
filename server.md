This code sets up a basic server using the Express framework in Node.js. It also establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

Here is a breakdown of what the code does:

    It imports necessary modules: express, mongoose, and cors.
    It imports two route files: authRoutes and userRoutes.
    It creates an instance of the Express application using express().
    It enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) middleware to allow requests from a specific address (http://127.0.0.1:3000) and specifies allowed methods and headers.
    It adds middleware to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads using express.json().
    It sets up route handlers for /user using userRoutes and for other routes using authRoutes.
    It connects to a MongoDB database located at mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/habit-hero using Mongoose. It enables certain options for the connection ({ useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }).
    If the connection to the MongoDB database is successful, it logs a message indicating the successful connection. Otherwise, it logs an error message.
    It starts the server to listen on port 5000. Once the server is running, it logs a message indicating that the server is running on port 5000.
