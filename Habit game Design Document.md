Design Document

This design document serves as the foundation for the Gamified Habit Tracker website project. The aim is to create a website that helps users track and manage their habits effectively, while providing an engaging and enjoyable game experience.

Objectives:

    Create an easy-to-use habit tracking system.
    Implement engaging game mechanics to motivate users.
    Develop a reward system to encourage habit completion.
    Offer customization and personalization options.
    Include social features for collaboration and competition.

Initial Goals:

    Authentication:
        Implement user authentication to allow users to create profiles and store habit data and other information associated with their profile.

    Basic Habit Tracker:
        Set up a responsive React front-end for the habit tracker.
        Users should be able to create recurring habits with customizable intervals (e.g., every "x" days/weeks/months).
        Habit data should be stored in a database or set of databases.

    Database Setup:
        Design and implement a simple and beginner-friendly database configuration.
        The database should store information such as habits, points, and heroes.

Next Goal:

    Reward System:
        Each completed habit should generate "coins" as a reward.
        Users can recruit heroes, similar to RPG characters, who have names, stats, and inventories that can be improved by investing points.
        Heroes should have a gameplay loop, including actions like "Train" to improve their stats, "Rest" to recover HP, and "Adventure" to procure loot. Users can allocate coins to heroes while they are in these statuses.

Additional Features:

    Point System:
        Points should serve as a currency that users can utilize.
        Users can spend points on various in-game features or upgrades.
